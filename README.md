- Generating multiple files from templates quickly.

### Task Board

- Manage tasks in TODO.md - a plain text markdown file.
- The syntax is compatible with [Github Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/#task-list-items-extension-)
- TODO.md file is portable and can be committed with Pull Requests (PRs) to git repositories.

#### Usage:
- Open Coddx Task Board:
  - Bring up the Command Palette (F1), type and select: Coddx: Task Board.
- When interacting with the Task Board, TODO.md will be created or updated automatically.
- Vice versa, TODO.md can be edited manually, Task Board will load it every time.
