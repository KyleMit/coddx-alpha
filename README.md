# Coddx

Coddx - a collection of tools that help developers program efficiently.

Some useful features like:

- Task Board - manage tasks and save them as TODO.md - a simple plain text file.
- Generating multiple files from templates quickly.

<hr />

### Task Board

- Manage tasks with [TODO.md format](https://bit.ly/2JdEuET) - a plain text markdown file.
- The syntax is compatible with [Github Markdown](https://bit.ly/2wBp1Mk)
- TODO.md file is portable and can be committed with Pull Requests (PRs) to git repositories.
- Support custom file name, multiple task lists.
- Checkboxes are optional (if your task titles don't have them).
- See also: <a href="https://bit.ly/2WHprLW">Documentation / Guides</a>

#### Usage:

- Open Coddx Task Board:
  - Bring up the Command Palette (F1), type and select: Coddx: Task Board.
- When interacting with the Task Board, TODO.md will be created or updated automatically.
- Vice versa, TODO.md can be edited manually, Task Board will load it every time (click the Refresh icon).
